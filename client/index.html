                        In addition to this, I know the many different popular data structures,

                        I have done most of my Algorithm/Data Structure work in Python.
                        Both languages I have utilized Object-Oriented Design and have written

                <p>Growing up in Lockport, Illinois I have always enjoyed
                    technology. In high school I decided to take a couple coding classes
                    because it would be fun. Who would have thought the impact it would
                    have had on my life. I decided to major in Computer Science!
                </p>
                <p> Studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Lewis University
                    has been a mentally challenging, but equally intellectually 
                    stimulating time of my life. I have really enjoyed my studies so far and 
                    cannot wait to graduate in May of 2023 to pursue Software Engineering as a career!
